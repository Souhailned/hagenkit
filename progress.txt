# Task Progress

## Completed: RoleSelection Component

### What was done
- Created `components/onboarding/role-selection.tsx`
- Created `components/onboarding/README.md`

### Component Details
File: `components/onboarding/role-selection.tsx`

A two-card role selection component for the onboarding flow:
- **Seeker Card**: Building icon, "Ik zoek horeca ruimte", for users looking for hospitality spaces
- **Agent Card**: Briefcase icon, "Ik ben makelaar", for real estate agents

### Features Implemented
- Responsive grid (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on sm+)
- Hover states with shadow elevation and primary border hint
- Selected state with primary border (2px) and primary/5 background
- Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to select)
- ARIA attributes (role="button", aria-pressed, aria-label)
- Checkmark indicator on selected card
- Icon container with color transitions
- Uses theme CSS variables (no hardcoded colors)

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface RoleSelectionProps {
  selectedRole: RoleValue | null; // "seeker" | "agent" | null
  onSelect: (role: RoleValue) => void;
}
```

### Test Status
- Test cases documented in README.md
- Full tests ready to run once Vitest + RTL are installed

### Build/Lint Status
- ESLint: ✅ No errors in new files (pre-existing errors in codebase)
- TypeScript: ✅ Component compiles correctly
- Build: ⚠️ Build fails due to missing Prisma client (environment issue, not component-related)
