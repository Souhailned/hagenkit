   - completeSeekerOnboarding: Complete onboarding with profile data
   - getSeekerRecommendations: Get personalized property recommendations
   - isPropertySaved: Check if property is in user's favorites

5. **Created RefreshButton Component** (`components/dashboard/refresh-button.tsx`)

### Technical Notes:
- No testing framework is set up in the project, so tests were not written
- Lint passes with only warnings (unused parameters for future implementation)
- Build passes successfully
- Components use existing shadcn/ui components and follow project conventions
- Uses CSS theme variables (no hardcoded colors)

### Files Created:
- `types/property.ts`
- `app/actions/seeker-profile.ts`
- `components/property/property-card.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/seeker-dashboard.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/refresh-button.tsx`

### Dependencies:
- Database models (Property, SeekerProfile, etc.) from PRD Phase 1 needed for full functionality
- Once models exist, uncomment TODO sections in seeker-profile.ts actions
